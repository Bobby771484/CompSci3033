The program is meant to demonstrate and show how one can make and use two basic data structures
A single linked list made using nodes and pointers 
and a stack of intergers made using a vector 
with both being tested to show how each operation works and how the data is stored and retrived
You can compile and run it by opening the terminal in the project folder and then running 
 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra Main.cpp StackVector.cpp Single_Linked_List.cpp -o Assignment2
 The first one used was the push back command to push a value of 10 the back of the linked list
 then another pushing back of a 20 in the single linked list and finally a push front of a five in the single linked list

The next one was the inserting at a specfic point in the linked list itself
causing the size to go to 4 from 3

The next command that was tried was the find command where it found the location of a value in the linked list itself as shown it found the value 20 at the index of 3

Next up was the remove function which is meant to remove a value from the single list for example in this case it removed the value of one from the list Returning a true to indicate that its removed.

The next commands where pop_front and pop_back respectively with pop front removing a item from the front of the list and pop_back removing from the back of the list As I did with my program resulting in only one value remaing that of 10 and the size decrease from 3 to 1 with the empty boolean being set to false

Next up was the testing of the int stack (vectors)
With the frist command being simple and that of it just checking to make sure that the vector is empty or if its not empty

Next was just pushing to the front of the list respectively where the values of 10, 20, and 30

finally I used the pop function to remove the 30 from the top of the vector stack And getting the average of the values inside of the vector
