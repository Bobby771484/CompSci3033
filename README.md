The program is meant to demonstrate and show how one can make and use two basic data structures
A single linked list made using nodes and pointers 
and a stack of intergers made using a vector 
with both being tested to show how each operation works and how the data is stored and retrived
You can compile and run it by opening the terminal in the project folder and then running 
 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra Main.cpp StackVector.cpp Single_Linked_List.cpp -o Assignment2
 The first one used was the push back command to push a value of 10 the back of the linked list
 then another pushing back of a 20 in the single linked list and finally a push front of a five in the single linked list

The next one was the inserting at a specfic point in the linked list itself
causing the size to go to 4 from 3
